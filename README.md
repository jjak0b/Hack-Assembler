# Hack-Assembler
Specific assembler for the "hack assembler" about the nand2tetris project, coded to work on Cygwin
WARNING this Hack-Assembler project IS NOT OPTIMIZED so it can run slow if it's used to decode a lot of ASM to Hack-assembly instructions.
Read the wiki to learn how to use it

I set this repository to public just to help some computer science students who are having some throubles to develop this part of the nand2tetris project, so if you are a student you can see the code and i hope this will help you to understand some stuff but YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED to copy and use this as your project or work.

[ALERT FOR STUDENTS]
For example you aren't allowed to send this to your professor as your course project.
I can't stop you if you do it but i just alert you that some university courses use AI to understand if code is written by others people on the internet and the first site they check can be github.
I written this precisation because some people of my course was "stealing" some old code by previus part of  nand2tetrus project from other people on github and they had some penalities because of this !
Your are student, learn from these little project as much as you can so you can enhance yourself and the way you code !
